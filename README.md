P3 - Arcade Clone
=======================

Submission for Project 3 ( Arcade Clone ) of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. My interpretation "Internship" requires that the player crosses a busy street to retrieve coffee for his co-workers, taking care to return before its cold.

##### Assignment

The goal of this assignment was to gain additional experience working with object oriented ( namely pseudo-classical ) patterns and inheritance in javascript. Provided a simple game loop, and some visual assets ( though I created my own to fit the theme of my game ), we were required to construct a game not dissimilar to the classic 1981 Konami arcade game Frogger.
